    "Noise bias is a source of bias in shape estimation. Noise bias arises due to the non-linear relationship between images pixels and the true shape of a galaxy.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Shot Noise:** [Shot or Poisson noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise) arises from that fact that light from distant sources arrives in the form of discrete or quantized packets at random times.\n",
    "- **Readout Noise:** Readout or read noise is a source of Gaussian noise arising from the CCD electronics. As pixel values are read some electrons are randomly lost or gained. This has a greater impact on fainter images with shorter exposure times."

    "## Measuring Noise Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise bias can be estimated by adding noise to images where the shape of the galaxy in question is perfectly known then comparing the measured shape. This process should be repeated for various realisations of the noise model in order to guage the variance of the noise bias. "
