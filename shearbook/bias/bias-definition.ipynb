    "In most cases, shear bias can be decomposed in a multiplicative and an additive part.\n",

    "## Population shear bias\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the shear bias for a population of galaxies. First, let us recall the equation that,\n",
    "in the weak-lensing regime, relates observed and intrincic ellipticity to reduced shear,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon^{\\textrm{obs}}_\\alpha = \\varepsilon^{\\textrm{I}}_\\alpha + g\\alpha,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for components $\\alpha = 1, 2$. If the mean intrinsic ellipticity is zero, $\\langle \\varepsilon^{\\textrm{I}}_\\alpha \\rangle = 0$, the observed ellipticity is an unbiased estimator of the shear, $\\langle \\varepsilon^{\\textrm{obs}}_\\alpha \\rangle = g_\\alpha$ in this basic case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we now introduce the ensemble-average additive bias $c_\\alpha$, and multiplicative bias $m_\\alpha$, and write\n",

    "\n",
    "A common calibration method is to estimate the population biases $c_\\alpha$, $m_\\alpha$, by simulating a large number of galaxy images with different properties and shear. These measured values are then applied to the observed galaxy ellipticities. The quantity $(\\varepsilon^{\\textrm{obs}}_\\alpha - c_\\alpha) / (1 + m_\\alpha)$ is then an unbiased estimator of the reduced shear.\n",

    "## Individual galaxy shear bias\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the multiplicative bias in  {eq}`shear-estim-biased` can be interpreted as derivative, or response, of the average observed ellipticity with respect to the shear. Accounting for the two-component nature of ellipticity, and written for an individual galaxy, we define the response matrix $R$ ({cite}`2017arXiv170202600H`, {cite}`SH17`) by\n",
