    "1. Take a galaxy image, add noise to it and fit a model to estimate the ellipticity. The resulting estimate will include the effects of model bias, noise bias and their interaction.\n",
    "2. Find the best fitting model to a noiseless galaxy image, which accounts for model bias alone, add noise to this model and fit the same model to it, which accounts for model bias + noise bias.\n",

    "While tests with a toy model indicated that the level this effect could be up few perfect, tests on more realistic COSMOS images showed that this term is very small and often consistent with zero."
