    "Model bias is a source of bias in shape estimation for [model fitting methods](sec:model-fitting). Model bias arises when the true shape of the galaxy in question is not sufficiently well represneted by the fitted model. In other words, real galaxy morphologies are often more complicated than the models used to fit them, which leads to a bias in the shapes recovered. \n",
