# Non-parametric

```{warning}
In progress!
```

Describe the PSF modelling problem. Use stars to build a model and try to recover the PSF at galaxy positions.

Describe the main idea of a non-parametric model of the PSF.

Give an example, PSFEx (and MCCD maybe?).

_(Note) Should I give a more mathematical description of how one of the models (PSFEx for example) is build?_

_Maybe I can add some figures from the MCCD paper. Showing some of the eigenPSFs learned. Also, some observed CFIS star and the estimated PSF model._
