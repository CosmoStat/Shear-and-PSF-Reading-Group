# Parametric

```{warning}
In progress!
```

Describe the PSF modelling problem. Characterise the model as much as possible and try to fit the reduced number of parameters with observed stars. Then use the model to recover PSFs at galaxy positions.

Describe the main idea of a parametric model of the PSF.

Give an example, TinyTim.

_(Note) Should I give an example like of how the PSF is generated following an optic model? _
